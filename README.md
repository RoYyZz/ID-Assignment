# ID-Assignment

# One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.
The website I designed is about a interior design company for all types of houses in Singapore.
## Design Process

# In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure: As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
# Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 
The intended audience for this website is people who are looking for interior designers to design and makeover their house for them. This website caters to people who wants to makeover and renovate their own house but doesn't know how or what design to put into their own house. This website provide an area for people to see, consult and customize on their own house design whether it be smart home or a modern style home. 

I started off by designing the home page. I wanted to make the homepage as minimalistic and simple as possible so as not to overload information on the user. As the user, I feel that having a simple homepage is good as when I first open the homepage, I will not be overloaded with various detail especially if I am looking to renovate my house.

Secondly, I followed up on designing the about us page. On this page, firstly, there is the title of the page.I added this section so as to emphasize on the what the page is about. Secondly, you are able to find team member of the company such as CEO, Creative consultant and interior designer.
Lastly, there is the core values of the company. I added this section as if i am the user, I will want to find out more about the company itself.

Thirdly, I added the Contact Us Page. On the left side, there is the location, opening timing and location on where the showroom is. There is also the picture of the showroom below. I feel like as the user that this is important and I will want to see how the showroom looks like before heading down to the actual location. Lastly, there is also the contact us form if the user wishes to engage the company's services. There is input form such as Name,Contact Number, Type of house and Condition of the house. I feel like this is important as before engaging the service, the user will want to find about the quote from the company or the prices. This also allows the user to consult about any enquiries.

Lastly, I added the portfolio page. This page is essential as I feel that a user might want to see various work the company has done before , before engaging their services. There is various picture and a brief description about the different type of room.

At the bottom of the Portfolio,Contact Us, and About Us Page, there is the footer for Copyright.

### Existing Features

- Feature 3 - In the homepage, there is an animated buttom about Find Out More that links to the Contact Us Page.
- Feature 4 - Clicking on the Logo links you back to the homepage.
## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
2. When hovering over navigation bar, underline appears. When not hovering, there isn't any underline.
3. 


# You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Logo and navigation bar tends to overlap together when the screen is smaller, I have yet to find a solution to it despite trying different method.

On the portfolio page, when the screen is smaller, the container tends to go down further than I anticipated , and i have yet to solve the issue.
